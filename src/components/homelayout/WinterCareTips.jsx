          Winter Care Tips for Pets

          Winter season can be tough on your furry friends. Make sure to keep
          them warm, comfortable, and hydrated. Provide cozy bedding away from
          cold floors and drafts. Limit outdoor walks during freezing mornings,
          and always dry their paws and fur after coming back indoors to prevent
          chills or frostbite. Give them a balanced diet to maintain their body
          heat, and remember — short-haired pets might need an extra winter coat
          for extra warmth. A little extra love and care can make this winter
          season a happy one for your pet! 🐾❄️
